# galomix

Galomix is a lab appliance for running Galaxy severs.

Included with Galomix are Galaxy configurations for running a metabolomics lab appliance.

## Container Management

[Usernetes] is Galomix' default container management system. Kubernetes can be used instead. The advantage of Usernetes is that it can run containers without root privilege. An [overview of Usernetes](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/containers_k8s_rootless/) was presented at FOSDEM 2019.
